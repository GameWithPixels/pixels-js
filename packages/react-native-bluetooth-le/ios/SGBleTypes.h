/**
 * @defgroup Apple_Objective-C
 * @brief A collection of Objective-C classes that provides a simplified access to
 *        Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals.
 *
 * @note Some knowledge with Bluetooth Low Energy semantics is recommended for reading
 *       this documentation.
 *
 * The Systemic Games Bluetooth Low Energy library for Apple devices provides classes for
 * scanning for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) peripherals, connecting to and communicating with them.
 * Those classes are based on the Apple's Core Bluetooth framework.
 *
 * The SGBleCentralManagerDelegate class implements the Apple
 * <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbcentralmanagerdelegate">
 * CBCentralManagerDelegate</a> protocol.
 * It stores and notifies of discovered BLE peripherals, also notifies of peripherals
 * connection events and of the host device Bluetooth radio state changes.
 *
 * The SGBlePeripheralQueue class implements the Apple
 * <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbperipheraldelegate">
 * CBPeripheralDelegate</a> protocol.
 * It queues BLE operations to be performed with a BLE
 * <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbperipheral">
 * peripheral</a>, run them sequentially and notify of their outcome.
 * The next request is run one the current one completes (whether successfully or not).
 *
 * This library also includes a set of C functions to be called from Unity for acessing
 * Bluetooth devices.
 *
 * Below is a diagram of the main classes of this library:
